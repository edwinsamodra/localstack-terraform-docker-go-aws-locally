# About this Repository

We explore a tool called Localstack to locally emulate an AWS SQS queue and S3 bucket. This is a great way to run applications that interact with AWS services on your local machine.

We also provision these cloud resources using Terraform and we'll write some Go code that will interact with our cloud resources.
